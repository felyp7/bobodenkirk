        <p>I honestly would tell anyone young to start looking at stories and learning story, because I think that’s the next step after people go, ‘OK, I’ve had enough of that improvisation, I’ve had enough of those short comedy bits. Tell me a story, tell me a more complex story, something that lasts and maybe has a little more meaning to it.’ Don’t ever look at what’s happening now; look at what’s coming next.</p>
        <h1>--- Bob Odenkirk ---</h1>
        <p>If you're committed enough, you can make any story work. I once told a woman I was Kevin Costner, and it worked because I believed it.</p>
        <h1>--- Bob Odenkirk ---</h1>
        <p>We're all real people with moments of intense honesty and pathos and humanity. We all experience that, whether you're comedic or not.</p>
        <h1>--- Bob Odenkirk ---</h1>
        <p>My daughter got me a 'World's Best Dad' mug. So we know she's sarcastic.</p>
        <h1>--- Bob Odenkirk ---</h1>
        <p>Even if people end up doing awful things, you can empathize with their motives when you know them. When you get to know the person, you can understand why they make those choices, even if they're bad. And oftentimes people do have good drives that are sympathetic and can even be seen as selfless and good-hearted.</p>
        <h1>--- Bob Odenkirk ---</h1>
        <p>The laugh is what trumps everything.</p>
        <h1>--- Bob Odenkirk ---</h1>
        <p>Comedy is tragedy plus timing.</p>
        <h1>--- Bob Odenkirk ---</h1>
        <p>You say you're going to be the pope, become the pope.</p>
        <h1>--- Bob Odenkirk ---</h1>
        <p>Don't say you're going to stop eating red meat when you like red meat.</p>
        <h1>--- Bob Odenkirk ---</h1>
        <p>We don't feel constrained by what we did in the past.</p>
        <h1>--- Bob Odenkirk ---</h1>
        <p>If you surround me with darkness, suddenly, I am "somewhat fun."</p>
